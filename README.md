# Eye on Manga

Is an application for Maemo 5 and the Nokia N900.  It lets you keep a
list of the manga you have collected and still need to collect.

## Why?

When out looking for manga, whenever I would find some I was
collecting I couldn't remember which ones I already had.  And I don't
like walking around with pieces of paper in my wallet either.  I have
this phone that allows me to write software for it, I'm a developer
and I have a great interest in C programming, sounds perfect to write
something for.
